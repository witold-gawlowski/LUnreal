* fractal music
* fractal dungeon generation
* reminding chomskys theory before to learn about automatas before
	* maby there is some
* Octet
* using algorithmic bauty of plants

formal requirements:
* file feed -> program -> output
* at least 8 different files with nice output
* separation of your code vs octet
* stepping through with hotkeys
* 1200 words descritpion with images
	* objectives
	* data classes
	* title page: name course name, module, title, date, illustration
	* video (>1min)
* report in latex
* elegance of whole project (code)



thaughts:
* basically its very similar to the dungeons genereted in conway's way
* research: stochasic L-system
* research: contex sensitivity
